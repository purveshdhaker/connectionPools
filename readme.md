# Connection Pool Implementation Comparison

This project demonstrates the implementation and performance comparison of a custom connection pool (`BasicConnectionPool`) with built-in connection pool libraries like c3p0, HikariCP, and Apache Commons DBCP 2.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Interface**: `ConnectionPool`
    - Defines the basic operations and properties of a connection pool such as `max_pool_size`, `getConnection`, `releaseConnection`, and `shutdown`.

2. **Implementation**: `BasicConnectionPool`
    - Implements the `ConnectionPool` interface.
    - Utilizes a list of connections created on startup to provide a fixed pool of connections.

3. **Threads**:
    - A set of threads performing parallel tasks.
    - Each thread performs a `pg_sleep(5)` operation using PostgreSQL JDBC.

## Usage

1. **BasicConnectionPool**:
    - The `BasicConnectionPool` class provides a straightforward implementation of a connection pool with a fixed number of connections.
    - Time taken: ~5s with 15 parallel threads.

2. **c3p0**:
    - Configuration and usage of c3p0 connection pool library.
    - Time taken: ~2s with c3p0 connection pool.

3. **HikariCP**:
    - Configuration and usage of HikariCP connection pool library.
    - Time taken: ~4s with HikariCP connection pool.

4. **Apache Commons DBCP 2**:
    - Configuration and usage of Apache Commons DBCP 2 connection pool library.
    - Time taken: ~4s with Apache Commons DBCP 2 connection pool.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Connection Pooling

## Advantages:

1. **Performance Improvement**: Connection pooling reduces the overhead of opening and closing database connections by reusing existing connections, leading to faster response times for database operations.

2. **Resource Utilization**: With connection pooling, database connections are managed efficiently, ensuring that resources are not wasted on creating and destroying connections repeatedly.

3. **Scalability**: Connection pooling allows applications to handle a large number of concurrent requests without overwhelming the database server, improving the scalability of the system.

4. **Connection Reuse**: Reusing existing connections reduces the load on the database server and helps prevent resource contention, leading to better overall system performance.

5. **Connection Management**: Connection pooling frameworks often provide features for monitoring and managing connections, such as setting timeouts, limiting the number of connections, and handling connection errors gracefully.

## Disadvantages:

1. **Resource Consumption**: While connection pooling improves resource utilization, it still consumes memory and other system resources, especially if the pool size is large or connections are not released properly.

2. **Complexity**: Implementing and managing connection pooling requires additional code and configuration, which adds complexity to the application. Improper configuration or management can lead to connection leaks or inefficient resource usage.

3. **Potential for Deadlocks**: In a highly concurrent environment, connection pooling may increase the risk of deadlocks or contention for database resources, especially if connections are not released promptly or if the pool size is too small.

4. **Connection Leaks**: If connections are not properly closed and returned to the pool after use, it can result in connection leaks, where resources are not released, leading to memory leaks and degraded system performance over time.

5. **Overhead**: While connection pooling reduces the overhead of creating and closing connections, there is still some overhead associated with managing the pool, monitoring connections, and handling errors, which can impact performance in certain scenarios.
